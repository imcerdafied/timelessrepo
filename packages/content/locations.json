The completion of State Route 21 (later Interstate 680) made the valley commutable to Oakland and San Francisco, and the walnut orchards began coming down in favor of ranch houses and subdivisions. Alamo's position — not incorporated as a city, remaining unincorporated Contra Costa County — meant development was less regulated than in neighboring Danville and Walnut Creek. The Round Hill Country Club, established in 1961, set the tone for what the valley was becoming: an affluent suburban retreat for Bay Area professionals who wanted more space, better schools, and a different kind of life than the cities offered. The Bay Miwok village, the rancho headquarters, the walnut orchard — each had left little visible trace by the time the swimming pools arrived.",

Alamo, the most rural and least developed of the valley communities, attracted the buyers who wanted the largest lots and the most privacy. The hills that had been walnut orchards a generation earlier were now being graded for the custom homes and gated communities that would define the community's character through the following decades.

Alamo's real estate market, which had been among the most resilient in the Bay Area through earlier downturns, softened noticeably. But the structural factors that had made the valley attractive remained: the schools, the space, the Las Trampas hills visible from every backyard. The valley recovered faster than most of the Bay Area, and by 2005 the housing market had returned to its upward trajectory. The 2008 financial crisis brought a second, sharper correction, but the pattern held: Alamo's real estate declined less and recovered faster than comparable Bay Area communities.",
